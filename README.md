F = Gm1m2/r^2

G = -6.67 * 10^-11 Nm^2/kg^2
m1 in kg
m2 in kg
F = Gravitational Force (N)
r = distance between the centers of gravity in meters.

g = 9.78033m/s^2

F = ma
if a = g, then F = 9.8 * mass = Newtons = m*kg/s*s

ma = Gm1m2/r^2
a = Gm2/r^2 = m/s^2 = Nm^2/kg^2 * kg/m^2 = N/kg = m/s*s
F = Gm1m2/r^2
if m1,m2,and r are known: F = Newtons = m*kg/s*s
So, for each object, the acceleration would be F/m = a

Only the radius is non-constant.
For each pair of Entities, the constant between them can be calculated at the start.  Then the formula would just consider the current distance between them.

a = GMm/Mr^2 = Gm/r^2
Store Gm and divide by r^2.
Every second, modify the speed of each by a toward one another.

earth's radius = 6.4 * 10^6 meters
